			<h1>The Tor Project</h1>
			<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en" target="_blank">The Tor Project</a> is a network that aids individuals in
			maintaining their online privacy and anonymity. The Tor network is just a network of specially configured computers or "nodes" that send your internet traffic 
			to several different places before eventually sending it to the intended destination, obfuscating users' real location and 
			encrypting their traffic. This means that websites that employ geolocation or advertisement-tracking services can't determine a Tor user's 
			location or effectively track them. The encryption also prevents internet service providers (ISPs) or other users from eavesdropping on a Tor user's traffic.</p>
			
			<p>The Tor Project also provides a browser that's specially configured to use Tor and to run privacy-protecting settings, such as blocking tracking cookies and 
			preventing sites from fingerprinting the browser (to prevent being tracked across multiple sites). For most users, the Tor Browser alone 
			should provide a major improvement in their browsing privacy.</p>
			
			<h2>What's the point of using Tor?</h2>
			<p>Tor ensures that a user's ISP or other users on their network can't read their traffic. The browser is hardened
			against privacy-compromising techniques and limits information leakage. Overall, Tor provides a dramatic improvement for online privacy.</p>
			
			<p>Depending on what parts of your privacy you want to maintain, you may not need to use Tor all the time, either. You may, for example, only want to use
			Tor when you're on a hotel network or in a coffee shop--any public network that could allow other users to eavesdrop on your online browsing.</p>
			
			<h2>Are there any disadvantages?</h2>
			<p>Using Tor will involve changing your browsing habits a bit. It's important not to connect to personal accounts, such as social media or email, 
			that you also use off of Tor; this can de-anonymize you. It's also worth noting that, because Tor re-routes your traffic before sending it to the destination,
			using Tor will be slightly slower than normal browsing.</p>
			
			<h2>Further information</h2>
			<p>Below is a brief video that describes the basics of how Tor works and how users can apply it.</p>
