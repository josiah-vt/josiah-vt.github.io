			<h1>The Tor Project</h1>
			<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en" target="_blank">The Tor Project</a> provides networking and software to help individuals 
			maintain their anonymity online. Tor itself is simply a network of servers or "nodes" that route your online traffic before sending it to its destination, 
			obfuscating your location and encrypting your traffic. This means that websites that employ geolocation or ad-tracking services won't be able to 
			determine a Tor user's real location or effectively track them.</p>
			
			<p>In addition, the Tor Project provides a browser that's specially configured to use Tor and to implement several features that help protect individuals'
			privacy, such as blocking tracking cookies and preventing sites from fingerprinting the browser (to prevent being tracked across multiple sites). For most
			users, the Tor Browser alone should satisfy all of their needs.</p>
			
			<h2>What's the point of using this?</h2>
			<p>Tor conceals the servers users are communicating with, so their ISP or other users on their network can't read their traffic. The browser is hardened
			against privacy-compromising techniques and limits information leakage. It significantly improves online privacy.</p>
			
			<p>Depending on what parts of your privacy you want to maintain, you may not need to use Tor all the time, either. You may, for example, only want to use
			Tor when you're on a hotel network or in a coffee shop--any public network that could allow other users to eavesdrop on your online browsing.</p>
			
			<h2>Are there any disadvantages?</h2>
			<p>Using Tor will involve changing your browsing habits a bit. It's important not to connect to personal accounts that you also use off of Tor (like social
			media accounts), since that behavior will de-anonymize you. It's also worth noting that, because Tor re-routes your traffic before sending it to the destination,
			using Tor will be slightly slower than normal browsing.</p>
