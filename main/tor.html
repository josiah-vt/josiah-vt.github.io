			<h1>The Tor Project</h1>
			<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en" target="_blank">The Tor Project</a> is a network that aids individuals in
			maintaining their online privacy and anonymity. The Tor network is just a network of specially configured computers or "nodes" that send your internet traffic 
			to several different places before eventually sending it to the intended destination, obfuscating users' real locations and 
			encrypting their traffic. Sites that employ geolocation or advertisement-tracking can't determine a Tor user's 
			location or track them. The encryption also prevents internet service providers (ISPs) or other users from eavesdropping on a Tor user's traffic.</p>
			
			<p>The Tor Project also provides a unique browser that's pre-configured to connect to the Tor network. It also runs some useful privacy-protecting settings that block 
			tracking cookies and prevent sites from fingerprinting the Tor browser (which is a method that could enable a user to be tracked across different sites or even
			be identified months later). Using the Tor Browser should provide a major improvement in one's browsing privacy.</p>
			
						
			<h2>What's the point of using Tor?</h2>
			<p>Tor ensures that a user's traffic can't be read by their ISP or by malicious users on the same internet connection. The Tor browser itself is also configured to prevent
			one's privacy being compromised by cookies or other common tracking techniques. Overall, Tor provides a dramatic improvement for online privacy.</p>
			
			<p>You don't necessarily need to exclusively use Tor from now on. You might only be interested in using
			Tor when you're using a public place's internet connection, like hotel or a coffee shop. In public places, there's a much higher chance of a
			malicious user hijacking your traffic and compromising your privacy, so it's the perfect time to use Tor.</p>
			
			<h2>What are the disadvantages?</h2>
			<p>Using Tor by itself isn't enough. As the Tor Browser warns you whenever you launch it, you should change your online habits when on Tor. 
			Don't use your personal social media or email accounts that you connect to without Tor; this can de-anonymize you. Since Tor re-routes 
			traffic before directing it to your chosen site or server, browsing with Tor is a bit slower than browsing without it.</p>
			
			<h2>Further information</h2>
			<p>Below is a brief video that describes the basics of how Tor works and how users can apply it.</p>
