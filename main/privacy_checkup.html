            <h1>Privacy Checkup</h1>
            <p>If you've decided you care about online privacy and anonymity, you'll likely want to examine your own online presence. It's almost impossible to remember every			
			online profile or post you've ever made, and sometimes it's not obvious that certain online habits can compromise one's privacy. The resources below
			can aid you in discovering which areas of your online presnce could be kept more private. As always, it's up to you to decide how much privacy you want and
			what information you value.</p>
		
			
			<h2>ip-check.info</h2>
			<p>This site visually displays info that your browser leaks whenever you visit any page on the web. It's a startling
			look at how you might inadvertently leak information solely by browsing the web. Follow <a href="http://ip-check.info/?lang=en" target="_blank">this link</a> to
			give the test a shot.</p>
			
			<h2>snoopsnoo.com</h2>
			<p>If you're a Reddit poster, you might find <a href="http://snoopsnoo.com/" target="_blank">snoopsnoo.com</a> to be a useful tool. This site
			analyzes Reddit accounts and views all of a poster's public activity. The analytics determine the user's interests, subreddits on which they most commonly post, 
			posts that were highly popular or unpopular, and what a user spends most of their time discussing. All of this is a good reminder of what 
			info you might accidentally surrender via seemingly innocuous posts.</p>
			
			<h2>Google's privacy checkup</h2>
			<p>Though it's simpler and produces less startling results than the resources above, Google's<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/intro/privacycheckup" target="_blank"> privacy checkup</a>
			is a good way to be certain that you haven't inadvertently made sensitive information accessible to others. If you haven't ever used this tool before, spend a few minutes with it; 
			it's critical to be aware of what others can see on your Google account, especially because it's connected to see many places--Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs or Slides,
			just to name a few.</p>
		
			<h2>Assorted social media checkups</h2>
			<p>If you have any social media accounts, it's likely that they have specific privacy settings enabled. Perhaps you only want friends to be able to see what
			you post, for example. However, as these online services are updated and changed, these settings can also change without users' knowledge. Therefore, it's worth
			checking your social media accounts and their privacy settings occasionally. Doing so will keep you up-to-date with what others can view on your account. Take some
			time and review each of your accounts carefully; many even have privacy checkup tools that will walk you through the most salient settings.</p>
