            <h1>Privacy Checkup</h1>
            <p>As you learn about internet privacy, you may be interested in knowing where you currently stand. Just how anonymous are you? How easily-invaded
			is your privacy at the moment? While some of this is evaluation that only you can do--considering what you announce to the world by posting 
			on social media, for example--there are some helpful tools or writeups that can help you determine what sort of information you might be inadvertently
			leaking.</p>
			
			<p>It's important to keep in mind that not all information leakage is inherently bad, and it's ultimately up to you what sort of information you
			consider private and how much work you want to do to maintain your privacy. These are just some tools to help you evaluate the current state of your online
			privacy.</p>
			
			<h2>ip-check.info</h2>
			<p>This is a website that peforms a check to see what kind of information is leaked by your browser every time you visit a web page. It's often startling
			how easy it is to inadvertently compromise one's privacy just by browsing the internet. Follow <a href="http://ip-check.info/?lang=en">this link</a> to
			try the test for yourself.</p>
