            <h1>Privacy Checkup</h1>
            <p>As you learn about internet privacy, you may want to know the current state of your privacy. Just how anonymous are you? What information might you
			have inadvertently surrendered? While some of this is evaluation that only you can do--considering what you post on social media, for example--there are some useful 
			resources that can aid you in evaluating your current privacy and anonymity.</p>
			
			<p>It's important to keep in mind that not all information leakage is inherently bad, and it's ultimately up to you what sort of information you
			consider private and how much work you want to do to maintain your privacy. These are just some aids to get you thinking about what information you value.</p>
			
			<h2>ip-check.info</h2>
			<p>This is a website that visually displays info leaked by your browser whenever you visit any page on the web. It's often startling
			how easy it is to inadvertently compromise one's privacy just by browsing the internet. Follow <a href="http://ip-check.info/?lang=en" target="_blank">this link</a> to
			try the test for yourself.</p>
			
			<h2>snoopsnoo.com</h2>
			<p>If you post on Reddit, you might be interested in the site <a href="http://snoopsnoo.com/" target="_blank">snoopsnoo.com</a>. This site can
			analyze Reddit accounts and view all of an account's public activity. The analytics can determine the user's interests, subreddits on which they most commonly post, 
			posts that were highly popular or unpopular, and what a user spends most of their time discussing. All of this is a good reminder of what 
			personal information you might reveal through seemingly innocuous posts.</p>
			
			<h2>Google's privacy checkup</h2>
			<p>While it's less complex than the above tools, Google's<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/intro/privacycheckup" target="_blank"> privacy checkup</a>
			is useful to ensure that you're not accidentally making personal information publicly accessible. If you've never checked your privacy settings, you should
			be certain to do so; it's important to know what you're broadcasting to the world.</p>
