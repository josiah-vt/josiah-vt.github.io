            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>In recent years, internet privacy has become increasingly relevant. Many people are dependent on the internet, 
			whether for work-related tasks, socializing or entertainment. As internet usage has become more ingrained in our public and private lives, however, some users
			may not be aware of how their privacy is affected. Advertisers and corporations (as well as governments) benefit from tracking individuals' online activity; 
			there are more threats to individuals' privacy than ever before, which is cause for caution.</p>
			
			<p>This website is intended to help readers understand the importance of internet privacy and how they can protect their anonymity and privacy. 
			Not all of these methods or tools will apply to every user. A few are basic and straightforward, making them practical for most users, 
			while some are demanding and involve considerably more effort (though their impact can also be much more significant). Hopefully, this site can 
		    both inform individuals about the significance of online privacy and enable them to consider how they're affected. Ultimately, they should be able to make informed decisions
			about their privacy and understand its value.</p>
           
            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <p>If you've just begun learning about internet privacy, a good place to start
			is this <a href="overview.html" target="_blank">overview</a> of internet privacy. It provides some interesting articles, videos, and guides about privacy.
			If you're interested in learning why proponents of online privacy think this is such an important issue, or just want to understand basic threats to your privacy, consider beginning here.</p>
			
			<p>If you're looking for a condensed version of the overview above, consider listening to the brief audio recording <a href="audio_recording.html" target=blank">here</a>.
			It contains some brief snippets from some of the resources found in the overview section and discusses why privacy should matter to individuals.</p>
			
			<p>If you'd like an assessment of the current state of your online privacy, try this
			<a href="privacy_checkup.html" target="_blank">privacy checkup.</a> It'll take you through a series of privacy-checking tools and evaluations in order
			to determine how well you're maintaining your privacy right now. If you find that you're not as anonymous or private as you might like to be, you'll have an idea of what areas
			to work on.</p>
