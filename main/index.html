            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Over the past few years, internet privacy has become increasingly relevant. Many peoples' lives are predicated on internet 
			usage, either for work, socializing or entertainment. When the internet becomes such an integral part of our personal lives, however, some users
			may not consider the implications for their privacy. Advertisers, corporations and even governments are keenly interested in our online activity; 
			while this isn't necessarily viewed as negative by everyone, it does mean that the online privacy of individuals is far more likely to be compromised than
			ever before, which is cause for caution.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of this site is to help individuals understand why internet privacy is important, how easily they can compromise their own privacy, even
			inadvertently, and what measures they may want to take to protect their privacy. It's important to note that not all of these privacy measures will be for
			everyone; some are simple and easy to implement, while others are technologically complex and require far more dedication. The goal of this site is 
			to inform individuals about internet privacy and help them think about how this issue affects them. While everyone values their privacy differently, 
			all internet users should be aware of their right to privacy.</p>
           
            <h2>Getting started</h2>
