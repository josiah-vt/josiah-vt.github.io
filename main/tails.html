            <h1>Tails OS</h1>
			<p><a href="https://tails.boum.org/" target="_blank">Tails OS</a> is an operating system specifically designed to enhance online privacy and 
			anonymity. Tails is something you'd likely want to use if you're willing to invest significant effort in protecting your privacy; adopting Tails is 
			a bit more complex than many of the other privacy-enhancing tools or methods described on this site. However, it's also a great way to keep your online activity
			private and anonymous and to keep your computer secure.</p>
			
			<p>Tails OS is meant to be used as a live-boot operating system, which means that you'll carry the operating system around on a USB drive or a DVD
			and will insert this into your computer every time you want to use Tails. You can then boot your computer using the removable storage media you've brought
			in order to launch Tails. This means you can keep your day-to-day operating system installed amd only use Tails when you want to keep something private or secure.</p>
			
			<h2>What's the point of using this?</h2>
			<p>Tails automatically routes all of your traffic through Tor (which you can learn more about <a href="tor.html" target="_blank">here</a>) from the moment
			you boot your computer, which keeps all of your traffic private and encrypted. Because Tails is a live-boot OS, it also isn't susceptible to being tracked by cookies,
			fingerprinted by advertisers so they can recognize you in the future, or even forms of malware. This is because the Tails session only lasts as long as you have the computer
			running; as soon as you turn it off, the whole session ends and everything you did is wiped. This includes files you created or downloaded, so be sure to back them up!</p>
			
			<p>This means that you can safely browse the web without fear of tracking, targeted advertising, or having your files or traffic read by someone else. 
			As with Tor, you might especially want to use this when you're in a public place where you'd otherwise have no reasonable expectation of privacy or security.</p>
			
			<h2>Are there any disadvantages?</h2>
			<p>As effective and useful as Tails is, it also requires more effort to use than many simpler privacy-enhancing tools. Using it also involves constantly
			having a USB drive or other removable storage media available, and installing Tails so it can be live-booted. This isn't especially difficult, but it may
			seem daunting to those that have never tried it before. Additionally, Tails is Linux-based; while this keeps it relatively lightweight and secure, it may
			be challenging to adopt for those that have never used Linux. </p>
